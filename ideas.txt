Encoding
    Simple
    Encode numbers as (sign log number)
    Encode independent segments as a sequences of PEMDAS operations like 2 + (4 / 2 * 8)
Model Architecture
    Potentially double up the layers such that they can potentially mimic a 2-step process that a person would follow for PEMDAS
    Create a new layer? (Don't know what to exploit in order to do this)

Loss Function (Relative different encodings)
    - Regarding numbered encoding treat penalize each axis accordingly
    (so that a correct answer with an opposite magnitude is still considered mostly correct)
    - Potentially bin the numbers by 15% such that it is partially correct up to 15% and not after to reduce
    regression average sticking tendencies
